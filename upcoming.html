				<p>#Deadpool - February 12, 2016<br /><br />
					Based upon Marvel Comics' most uncommon anti-hero, DEADPOOL tells the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool.

	            <p>#Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - March 25 2016<br /><br />
	            	From director Zack Snyder comes "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," starring Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent in the characters' first big-screen pairing. Fearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City's own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis's most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before.</p>

	            <p>#Captain America: Civil War - May 6, 2016<br /><br />
	            	One year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, another international incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, prompting politicians to form a system of accountability and a governing body to determine when to call in the team. When Steve Rogers attempts to protect his friend Bucky Barnes from government hit squads, his efforts bring him into conflict with Tony Stark. This results in the fracturing of the avengers into two opposing factions while they attempt to protect the world from a new enemy.</p>

	            <p>#X-Men: Apocalypse - May 27, 2016<br /><br />
	            	Since ancient times the first and most powerful mutant, Apocalypse—immortal and invincible—has been worshipped as a god. But when Apocalypse awakens from hibernation and decides to end humanity, Raven and Charles Xavier lead a team of young X-Men to face Apocalypse and defeat him.</p>
